Hey!

These files don't really serve a purpose as of now.

I originally intended for the comic-cutscenes to be similar to Hex. In a way where the player has the option to progress through the comic at their own pace, with a press of a button. But due to the Hex source code not being public, and my inability to properly understand the dialogue box code and how I can just insert an flxsprite instead of the text box. aaaa, it's just too complex for my feeble brain.

So yeah, this are just here for the sake of being here. Might take up a bit of the storage and it goes unused, but I just wanted a place to put the images themselves just in case people that enjoy the comic want to take a better look at it for themselves.

I'm sorry if these files are potentially taking up some precious storage space. You can delete them with no consequence, it will not break anything in the game, trust me.

Again, thank you for downloading the mod, it really means a lot to me! Hope you enjoy it, and sorry if you didn't.
