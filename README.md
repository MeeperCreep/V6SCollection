# Friday Night Funkin': VS 6Soup Collection
## Download the Mod!
The **VS 6Soup Collection'** is a planned extention for the original *VS 6Soup Mod*. Feel free to reference this repository on your own mod! Though, I don't think there is any notable additions that aren't already in the Kade Engine. Still, I'm required to make the mod open-source by ninjamuffin99, so have fun! (I guess)
